                        <p>His ultimate dream fantasy consisted of being content and sleeping eight hours in a row.
                            She was disgusted he couldn’t tell the difference between lemonade and limeade.</p>

                        <p>He wondered if she would appreciate his toenail collection.
                            The rain pelted the windshield as the darkness engulfed us.
                            The external scars tell only part of the story.</p>

                        <p>Mom didn’t understand why no one else wanted a hot tub full of jello.
                            She lived on Monkey Jungle Road and that seemed to explain all of her strangeness.
                            One small action would change her life, but whether it would be for better or for worse was yet to be determined.
                            Two seats were vacant.
                            He told us a very exciting adventure story.</p>
